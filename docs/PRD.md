# ThesisChain Africa – Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
TechyJaunt × Camp Network $10,000 Buildathon – December 6 2025 Submission  
Target Tracks: Education (Primary) • Creativity • Community • Finance

### 1. Product Vision & Tagline
“Turn every final-year project in Africa into an evergreen, royalty-earning asset that can never be lost, stolen, or forgotten.”

ThesisChain is the first on-chain academic IP registry built on Camp Network that lets university students, researchers, and lecturers mint their theses and projects as composable IPNFTs, earn forever royalties when others build on them, and finally get discovered by employers and investors.

### 2. Problem Statement (Africa-Specific)
- 80–90 % of final-year projects across Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Uganda, South Africa, etc. disappear after graduation (PDFs on WhatsApp, lost USBs, dusty shelves).
- Zero proof of original authorship → rampant plagiarism and idea theft.
- No discoverability → talented students from non-elite universities stay invisible.
- No monetisation → students and supervisors never earn from citations, forks, or commercial adoption.
- Universities have no verifiable record of academic output → fake certificates thrive.

### 3. Solution Overview
ThesisChain = Notion + GitHub + OpenSea + Worldcoin for African academia, powered by Camp Network’s Origin SDK.

| Core Action               | What Happens on Camp Network                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Student uploads thesis    | Files → IPFS → Minted as composable IPNFT with 10–20 % royalty baked in                       |
| Supervisor validates      | Signs with wallet → on-chain “Verified” badge                                                 |
| Junior/student forks it   | Pays small license fee → mints derivative IPNFT → original author auto-earns royalty         |
| Company downloads or cites| Pays in USDC → royalties instantly split (40 % original, 10 % supervisor, 50 % all forkers)   |
| Everyone searches         | Fully on-chain searchable index + leaderboard by university, department, earnings            |
